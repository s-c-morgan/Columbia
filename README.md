# Columbia

This is a repository containing selected excercises and projects from my time as a student at Columbia.
The purpose of this repository is not to provide a comprehensive look at my coursework nor an accurate solutions manual for future students,
but to demonstrate my technical capabilities in the selected topics for future employers or collaborators.
